  <br><p> Hello, my name is Emily, and I am a member of Girls Who Codes! I got experience with coding for the first time from my freshmen
  year of highschool, and wanted to know more about coding ever since. I joined the Girls Who Code Summer Imersion Program to get better 
  at coding and be prepare for computer science classes. I want to major in something math or science related, and I'm considering a 
  carrer in computer science!</p> <br>
  
  <h2> Lessons Learned: </h2><br><br>
  <h3>Scratch: Who am I?</h3>
  <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/167340430/">The Project, About Me</a><br>
  <p>One of the first projects we had made was to explain about ourselves. The link will show you the game I had created for the project.
  I decided to make it like Pokemon, where the player can walk to the objects in the room and examine it. The arrow keys moves the terribly
  made player and touching the objects in the room makes the player learn more about me. If I had more time, I would make the player press
  a button to interact with the object when they are near it.</p>
  
  <h3>Scratch: Drawing Shapes</h3>
  <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/167431777/">The Project, Drawing Shapes</a><br>
  <p>Another Scratch project we did was to draw shapes. One of the things I was proud of was that I was able to use the answer people
  gave to the question to make the shape thay they want. I also have some code from the shapes I had made prior before making the final 
  product. I used am if then statement to make sure that the user was actually making a shape and nothing else. I also used the answer to
  make the object turn based off of 360 divided by the number of sides.</p>
  
  <h3>Scratch: Paddle Ball!</h3>
  <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/167555506/#player">The Project, Paddle Ball!</a><br>
  <p>This was a fun project! We were required to make a game like paddle ball. I decided to make a single and two player game of my
  project. One of the harder things to get done was getting the point system workig whle still having two player mode work, which cause
  a ton of broadcasts and separte and somewhat messy code, but it got to the results i wanted.</p>
  
  <h3>Scratch: Side-Scroller Game</h3>
  <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/167672173/">The development of the EJC Color Game!</a><br>
  <p>Another fun project. We had to make a side scroller game in a group of 3-4 people and have a level in it. I don't have the
  game with me, but the link has most of all the game mechanics in the game, such as unused ideas like the color change. The 
  gravity of the game gave us some problems, as well as the spinning circle used in the game. But in the end, we overcome that task
  and made the game.</p>
